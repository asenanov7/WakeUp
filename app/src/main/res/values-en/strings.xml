        Game rules: in front of you will be three figures, two at the bottom and one at the top, two of
        them will have numbers. It is necessary that the sum of the numbers from the two lower figures
        is equal to the number in the top figure, for this you need to insert the missing number.\n\nExample:
        in the top circle the number is 7, in one of the bottom ones there is a question mark, and in the
        other the number 4. So, in place of the question mark should be the number 3, because 3 + 4 = 7
